## Overview

XKRT is a **macro-dataflow runtime** that automates memory management alongside parallel task execution on heterogeneous multi-device architectures (CPUs + GPUs). The programmer expresses work as **tasks** with **data accesses**, and the runtime:

1. **Resolves dependencies** between tasks based on overlapping data accesses.
2. **Manages memory coherence** across devices -- allocating replicas, tracking validity, and issuing transfers.
3. **Schedules tasks** on the appropriate device once dependencies are satisfied and data is coherent.

## Software Stack

XKRT sits at the center of the software stack:

- **Above XKRT**: domain-specific libraries like XKBlas (multi-GPU BLAS), XKOMP (OpenMP runtime), and user applications.
- **Below XKRT**: device drivers for CUDA, HIP, Level Zero, SYCL, OpenCL, and the host CPU. XKRT also uses hwloc for hardware topology discovery and optionally NVML/RSMI/Level Zero Sysman for energy monitoring.

## Tasks

A **task** is a unit of work with:
- A **routine** -- the function to execute.
- Zero or more **data accesses** -- declared memory regions with a mode (read, write, etc.).
- A set of **flags** controlling its behavior.

Tasks are allocated on a per-thread stack for efficiency (no `malloc` per task). The variable-size layout is computed at compile time from the flag combination.

### Task Flags

Flags are set at task creation time and control which optional info structs are embedded in the task's memory layout. They are combined as a bitfield of type `task_flag_bitfield_t`.

**Layout flags** (set once before instantiation, affect the `task_t` memory layout):

| Flag | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `TASK_FLAG_ZERO` | `0` | No special flags. |
| `TASK_FLAG_ACCESSES` | `1 << 0` | Task declares data accesses. Embeds `task_acs_info_t` and the `access_t` array. |
| `TASK_FLAG_DETACHABLE` | `1 << 1` | Task completion is tied to external event completion (e.g., async kernel launches). Embeds `task_det_info_t` with a reference counter. |
| `TASK_FLAG_DEVICE` | `1 << 2` | Task may execute on a non-host device (GPU). Embeds `task_dev_info_t` with a target `device_unique_id`. Cannot be combined with `TASK_FLAG_DOMAIN`. |
| `TASK_FLAG_DOMAIN` | `1 << 3` | Children tasks of this task may have data dependencies between them. Embeds `task_dom_info_t` with a dependency domain. Cannot be combined with `TASK_FLAG_DEVICE`. |
| `TASK_FLAG_MOLDABLE` | `1 << 4` | Task may be recursively split by the runtime. Embeds `task_mol_info_t` with the split condition and argument size. |
| `TASK_FLAG_GRAPH` | `1 << 5` | Children tasks are recorded into a task dependency graph. Embeds `task_gph_info_t`. |
| `TASK_FLAG_RECORD` | `1 << 6` | Task has a record: emitted commands are buffered for later replay. Embeds `task_rec_info_t`. |

**Runtime flags** (can be set/unset dynamically after creation):

| Flag | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `TASK_FLAG_GRAPH_RECORDING` | `1 << 7` | Currently recording a task dependency graph. |
| `TASK_FLAG_GRAPH_EXECUTE_COMMAND` | `1 << 8` | Recorded commands are also executed (not just buffered). |
| `TASK_FLAG_REQUEUE` | `1 << 9` | Task must be re-queued after returning from its routine. |

### Task States

A task progresses through the following states during its lifetime:

| State | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `TASK_STATE_ALLOCATED` | 0 | Task memory is allocated and constructed. |
| `TASK_STATE_READY` | 1 | All dependencies are satisfied; data can be fetched. |
| `TASK_STATE_DATA_FETCHING` | 2 | Data is being transferred to the execution device. |
| `TASK_STATE_DATA_FETCHED` | 3 | Data is coherent on the device; routine can execute. |
| `TASK_STATE_EXECUTING` | 4 | The task routine is running. |
| `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` | 5 | Task completed; successor dependencies can be resolved. |
| `TASK_STATE_DEALLOCATED` | 6 | Task memory is freed (virtual state, never actually set). |

### Task Memory Layout

Tasks use a **variable-size memory layout** determined by their flags:

```
task_t | task_acs_info_t | task_det_info_t | task_dev_info_t |
       | task_dom_info_t | task_mol_info_t | task_gph_info_t |
       | task_rec_info_t | access_t[N]     | args
```

Only the info structs corresponding to set flags are present. A compile-time constexpr switch handles all 128 possible flag combinations, ensuring zero overhead for unused features.

### Moldable Tasks

A **moldable task** is a task that the runtime can recursively split. The programmer provides:
- A **split condition**: `(task_t*, access_t*) -> bool` returning `true` if the task should be subdivided.
- The runtime bisects the task's accesses and creates two child tasks, repeating until the condition is false.

This enables coarse-grained task submission with fine-grained automatic decomposition.

### Task Formats

A **task format** associates a label with per-architecture function pointers. This enables writing multi-target tasks:

```cpp
task_format_id_t fmt = runtime.task_format_put("my_kernel");
runtime.task_format_set(fmt, XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_HOST, host_impl);
runtime.task_format_set(fmt, XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_CUDA, cuda_impl);
runtime.task_format_set(fmt, XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_HIP,  hip_impl);
```

When the runtime schedules a task with this format on a CUDA device, it dispatches to `cuda_impl`; on the host, to `host_impl`.

Available format targets:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_HOST` | Host CPU |
| `XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_CUDA` | NVIDIA CUDA |
| `XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_HIP` | AMD HIP |
| `XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_ZE` | Intel Level Zero |
| `XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_CL` | OpenCL |
| `XKRT_TASK_FORMAT_TARGET_SYCL` | SYCL |

### Task Dependency Graphs (TDG)

XKRT supports **recording** a sequence of task submissions into a graph, then **replaying** that graph multiple times. This is useful for iterative computations where the same task structure repeats:

```cpp
task_dependency_graph_t tdg;
runtime.task_dependency_graph_record_start(&tdg, true);
// ... spawn tasks ...
runtime.task_wait();
runtime.task_dependency_graph_record_stop();

// Replay the same graph
runtime.task_dependency_graph_replay(&tdg);
runtime.task_dependency_graph_destroy(&tdg);
```

A TDG can also be lowered to a **command graph** for even lower-overhead replay:

```cpp
command_graph_t cg;
runtime.command_graph_from_task_dependency_graph(&tdg, &cg);
runtime.command_graph_replay(&cg);
runtime.command_graph_destroy(&cg);
```

## Data Accesses

An **access** declares that a task will touch a memory region with a given mode. Accesses are the foundation of XKRT's automatic dependency resolution and memory coherence.

### Access Modes

| Mode | Value | Semantics |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `ACCESS_MODE_R` | `0b00000001` | Read-only. Multiple concurrent readers are allowed. |
| `ACCESS_MODE_W` | `0b00000010` | Write. Sequential by default (only one writer at a time). |
| `ACCESS_MODE_RW` | `ACCESS_MODE_R \| ACCESS_MODE_W` | Read-write. Combination of read and write. |
| `ACCESS_MODE_V` | `0b00000100` | Virtual/incoherent. Declares a dependency edge without triggering data movement. |
| `ACCESS_MODE_VW` | `ACCESS_MODE_W \| ACCESS_MODE_V` | Virtual write. Write dependency without coherence. |
| `ACCESS_MODE_VR` | `ACCESS_MODE_R \| ACCESS_MODE_V` | Virtual read. Read dependency without coherence. |
| `ACCESS_MODE_D` | `0b00001000` | Detached. Dependencies are not fulfilled on task completion; the task itself is responsible for fulfilling them (used for async kernel completions). |

### Mapping to OpenMP 5.x/6.0 Dependency Types

| OpenMP modifier | XKRT mode | XKRT concurrency |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `in` | `ACCESS_MODE_R` | -- |
| `out` / `inout` | `ACCESS_MODE_W` | `ACCESS_CONCURRENCY_SEQUENTIAL` |
| `mutexinoutset` | `ACCESS_MODE_W` | `ACCESS_CONCURRENCY_COMMUTATIVE` |
| `inoutset` | `ACCESS_MODE_W` | `ACCESS_CONCURRENCY_CONCURRENT` |

### Access Concurrency

| Concurrency | Semantics |
|-------------|-----------|
| `ACCESS_CONCURRENCY_SEQUENTIAL` | Default. Strict ordering between writers. |
| `ACCESS_CONCURRENCY_COMMUTATIVE` | Multiple writers may execute in any order, but not concurrently (mutual exclusion). |
| `ACCESS_CONCURRENCY_CONCURRENT` | Multiple writers may execute concurrently (no mutual exclusion). |

### Access Scope

| Scope | Semantics |
|-------|-----------|
| `ACCESS_SCOPE_NONUNIFIED` | Access is resolved in a local dependency domain. |
| `ACCESS_SCOPE_UNIFIED` | Access is resolved in the unified (global) dependency domain. |

### Access Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ACCESS_TYPE_SEGMENT` | Contiguous 1D memory interval `[begin, end)`. |
| `ACCESS_TYPE_HANDLE` | Opaque handle dependency (address-based, like a pointer). |
| `ACCESS_TYPE_BLAS_MATRIX` | 2D matrix tile described by leading dimension, row/column counts, and element size. |
| `ACCESS_TYPE_NULL` | No memory region (used for pure synchronization dependencies). |

### Dependency Resolution

Dependencies between tasks are computed by the runtime based on overlapping accesses:
- **Read-after-Write (RAW)**: a reader must wait for the previous writer.
- **Write-after-Read (WAR)**: a writer must wait for all previous readers.
- **Write-after-Write (WAW)**: a writer must wait for the previous writer.

The dependency domain uses interval trees (for segment accesses) or hash maps (for handle accesses) to efficiently find overlapping accesses.

## Memory Coherence

XKRT maintains a **coherence controller** for each tracked memory region. When a task requires data on a specific device:

1. The coherence controller checks if a valid replica exists on the target device.
2. If not, it finds a valid replica elsewhere (host or another device) and issues a copy command.
3. The replica is marked as valid on the target device, and invalidated on other devices after writes.

This is similar to a cache coherence protocol but operates at the software level across discrete memory spaces.

### Memory Registration (Pinning)

Before DMA transfers can occur between host and device memory, host pages must be **registered** (pinned) with the device drivers. XKRT provides synchronous and asynchronous variants, including parallel registration using `n` tasks for large buffers.

### Data Distribution

XKRT provides utilities to pre-distribute data across devices before computation:

| Distribution type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `XKRT_DISTRIBUTION_TYPE_CYCLIC1D` | 1D cyclic block distribution. |
| `XKRT_DISTRIBUTION_TYPE_CYCLIC2D` | 2D cyclic distribution. |
| `XKRT_DISTRIBUTION_TYPE_CYCLIC2DBLOCK` | 2D block-cyclic distribution (common for dense linear algebra). |

Distribution is implemented by spawning empty tasks with read accesses, which triggers the coherence protocol to create replicas on the target devices.

## Drivers

A **driver** (`driver_t`) abstracts a device backend. Each driver provides function pointers for:
- Device lifecycle (init, finalize, create, destroy)
- Memory management (allocate, deallocate, register, unregister)
- Data copies (host-to-device, device-to-host, device-to-device, sync and async)
- Kernel launch
- Queue management
- Module loading (for compiled kernels)
- Energy monitoring

Supported driver types:

| Driver type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `XKRT_DRIVER_TYPE_HOST` | Host CPU (always present). |
| `XKRT_DRIVER_TYPE_CUDA` | NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA Driver API. |
| `XKRT_DRIVER_TYPE_HIP` | AMD GPUs via ROCm HIP. |
| `XKRT_DRIVER_TYPE_ZE` | Intel GPUs via Level Zero. |
| `XKRT_DRIVER_TYPE_SYCL` | SYCL-compatible devices. |
| `XKRT_DRIVER_TYPE_CL` | OpenCL devices. |

Drivers are compiled as separate shared libraries (`libxkrt_driver_cu.so`, `libxkrt_driver_hip.so`, etc.) and loaded at runtime.

---

## Thread Teams

A **team** is a group of OS threads that cooperatively execute tasks. Each device has an associated team. Teams support:
- **Work stealing**: idle threads steal tasks from busy threads' deques.
- **Barriers**: synchronize all threads in a team (optionally with work stealing during the wait).
- **Critical sections**: mutual exclusion within a team.
- **Parallel for**: distribute loop iterations across team threads.
