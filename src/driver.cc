 * Launch a host PROG command according to its launch mode. The launcher is the
 * variadic `void(void**)` function; how it is invoked (and when the command
 * completes) depends on `prog.launch_mode`:
 *
 *   - DIRECT     : the calling thread runs the launcher and the command
 *                  completes as soon as it returns.
 *   - TASK_SPAWN : the runtime spawns a task in the calling thread's team that
 *                  runs the launcher; the command completes when that task
 *                  completes. This is how OpenMP outlined task bodies are
 *                  replayed (the task-spawn used to be baked into the launcher
 *                  function itself, which prevented CGIR from fusing them).
 *
 * In both cases the command's completion callback is raised once the program
 * has run, driving the command-graph replay forward.
 */
/* Run a host PROG command's body once, dispatching on its function prototype
 * (see command_prog_function_prototype_t):
 *   - VARIADIC: a JIT'd/fused program on the uniform `void(void**)` shape,
 *     invoked over prog.args (the deduplicated/compacted &value slots).
 *   - KMP: a recorded OpenMP task body that was NOT JIT-compiled; run it directly
 *     through its ahead-of-time libomp routine `fn(gtid, task)`. Recorded bodies
 *     replay with gtid 0 (as the previous replay path did). */
